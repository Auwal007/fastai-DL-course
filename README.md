# FastAI Deep Learning Course

Welcome to my FastAI Deep Learning Course repository! 🚀

This repository contains my journey through the FastAI course, including detailed notes, Jupyter notebooks, and practical implementations of deep learning concepts.

## 📚 About FastAI

FastAI is a deep learning library that simplifies training fast and accurate neural networks using modern best practices. This repository is based on the **2022 FastAI course**, which covers practical deep learning for coders and makes state-of-the-art deep learning accessible to everyone.

The course closely follows the FastAI book: **"Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch"** by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger, providing both theoretical foundations and practical implementations.
